# Financial Planning Accelerated Futures
## Motivation and Explanation
For the majority of Americans, financial planning is crucial in order to comfortably retire. It's important to start saving early, and consistently make payments into a retirement account such as a 401(k). [According to research from Fidelity, the nation's largest retirement plan provider, a 25-year old would need to put away $160 a month to have a $1,000 monthly retirement income, whereas a 35-year old would need to put away $270 a month, and a 45-year old would need to put away $500 a month.](http://www.today.com/money/why-youre-probably-not-saving-enough-your-401-k-8C11015682)

Furthermore, paying an upfront cost of a few thousand dollars for an accredited financial planner can have large dividends:

>[The average retirement wealth of those who used a financial planner and had estimated retirement needs was $246,797. Households who had estimated retirement needs but had not used a financial planner saved $163,659.](https://www.onefpa.org/journal/Pages/NOV14-A-Comparison-of-Retirement-Strategies-and-Financial-Planner-Value.aspx)

However, it's difficult to visualize and place importance on events that may not happen for 40 years; the short-term benefits of using the money that should be placed toward retirement/smart financial investment decisions for luxury goods or fun activities is more immediate and easier to think of. Thus, by placing an imagined future where the user can experience the retirement that they have been able to save for, we hope that the long-term impact of decisions made now will be more clearly felt.

Our project has two major decision moments:

1. The decision on whether to purchase an expensive sportscar or one more fitting your price range
2. The decision on whether to hire a financial planner or take a vacation

Each decision will show an outcome depending on the user's choice. If the player chooses the more immediately gratifying result (sportscar, vacation), they'll get to enjoy their purchase, whereas if they choose the more financially responsible result they'll experience a more tame experience (driving a sedan, meeting their financial planner). However, depending on their choices they will then experience a varying retirement quality.

The experience of making a choice between a short-term and a long-term benefit should resonate with everyone, and the disappointment that comes with having to deny yourself the more immediately gratifying choice. Users should be able to empathize with the situation and relate it to decisions within their own lives.
